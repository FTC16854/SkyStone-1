JWN NOTES AFTER KINGSTON
1. Autonomus to park on line
2. Speed control for robot
    Enable a curve/ramp on the input?
    Different curve for turning vs movement?
    Fast / slow mode?
3. Digital controls for gripper and gripper arm? Press once close, press once open? Debounce is fun.
4. Experiment with encoder based lift levels
